## Applications of HandWritten Numbers Recognition
Handwritten numbers recognition refers to the ability of a computer system to identify and interpret handwritten digits or numbers. It is a subfield of optical character recognition (OCR) and falls under the broader domain of machine learning and pattern recognition.

The goal of handwritten numbers recognition is to develop algorithms and models that can accurately classify and interpret handwritten digits. This technology has numerous applications, such as:

- Postal automation: Handwritten numbers recognition is used in postal services to automatically sort mail by reading and interpreting handwritten zip codes or addresses.

- Bank check processing: When processing bank checks, handwritten numbers recognition is employed to read and extract information such as the account number, amount, and check date.

- Form processing: Handwritten numbers recognition is utilized in processing forms that contain handwritten information, such as surveys or application forms.

- Digitizing historical documents: Handwritten numbers recognition can assist in digitizing historical documents or manuscripts that contain numerical data. This enables researchers and archivists to efficiently search and analyze large volumes of handwritten documents.

Handwritten digit recognition for user input: In applications such as digital tablets or touchscreens, handwritten numbers recognition can be used to convert handwritten input into digital format. This allows users to write numbers directly on the device instead of using a keyboard or touchscreen.

Handwritten numbers recognition systems typically employ machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks or support vector machines, to learn from a large dataset of handwritten digits. These algorithms learn to recognize patterns and features that differentiate different numbers, allowing them to make accurate predictions or classifications when presented with new handwritten digits.

To Run the code you must have all the dependencies installed
 
## Libraries
- tensorflow
- scipy
- numpy
- pygame
- matplotlib 
  
After that run the process_image.py file.

Then just run the app.py file and it will work.
